Consequently, LLM^3 interfaces between task planning and motion\nplanning, alleviating the intricate design process of handling domain-specific\nmessages between them. Through a series of simulations in a box-packing domain,\nwe quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM^3 in solving TAMP\nproblems and the efficiency in selecting action parameters. Ablation studies\nunderscore the significant contribution of motion failure reasoning to the\nsuccess of LLM^3. Furthermore, we conduct qualitative experiments on a physical\nmanipulator, demonstrating the practical applicability of our approach in\nreal-world settings.\n","authors":["Shu Wang","Muzhi Han","Ziyuan Jiao","Zeyu Zhang","Ying Nian Wu","Song-Chun Zhu","Hangxin Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11552v2.pdf","comment":"Submitted to IROS 2024.

One framework here is\nreinforcement learning, where the robot is given a reward function that encodes\nthe task, and the robot autonomously learns actions to maximize its reward.\nExisting approaches to reinforcement learning often frame this problem as a\nMarkov decision process, and learn a policy (or a hierarchy of policies) to\ncomplete the task. These policies reason over hundreds of fine-grained actions\nthat the robot arm needs to take: e.g., moving slightly to the right or\nrotating the end-effector a few degrees. But the manipulation tasks that we\nwant robots to perform can often be broken down into a small number of\nhigh-level motions: e.g., reaching an object or turning a handle. In this paper\nwe therefore propose a waypoint-based approach for model-free reinforcement\nlearning. Instead of learning a low-level policy, the robot now learns a\ntrajectory of waypoints, and then interpolates between those waypoints using\nexisting controllers. Our key novelty is framing this waypoint-based setting as\na sequence of multi-armed bandits: each bandit problem corresponds to one\nwaypoint along the robot's motion. We theoretically show that an ideal solution\nto this reformulation has lower regret bounds than standard frameworks. We also\nintroduce an approximate posterior sampling solution that builds the robot's\nmotion one waypoint at a time.

This paper proposes a method to remedy this\nprocess by considering hardware-level reusability, using\nLearning-from-observation (LfO) paradigm with a pre-designed skill-agent\nlibrary. The LfO framework represents the required actions in\nhardware-independent representations, referred to as task models, from\nobserving human demonstrations, capturing the necessary parameters for the\ninteraction between the environment and the robot. When executing the desired\nactions from the task models, a set of skill agents is employed to convert the\nrepresentations into robot commands. This paper focuses on the latter part of\nthe LfO framework, utilizing the set to generate robot actions from the task\nmodels, and explores a hardware-independent design approach for these skill\nagents. These skill agents are described in a hardware-independent manner,\nconsidering the relative relationship between the robot's hand position and the\nenvironment. As a result, it is possible to execute these actions on robots\nwith different hardware configurations by simply swapping the inverse\nkinematics solver. This paper, first, defines a necessary and sufficient\nskill-agent set corresponding to cover all possible actions, and considers the\ndesign principles for these skill agents in the library.

However, in the\nreal-world where test ground truths are not provided, it is non-trivial to find\nout whether bounding boxes are accurate, thus preventing us from assessing the\ndetector generalization ability. In this work, we find under feature map\ndropout, good detectors tend to output bounding boxes whose locations do not\nchange much, while bounding boxes of poor detectors will undergo noticeable\nposition changes. We compute the box stability score (BoS score) to reflect\nthis stability. Specifically, given an image, we compute a normal set of\nbounding boxes and a second set after feature map dropout. To obtain BoS score,\nwe use bipartite matching to find the corresponding boxes between the two sets\nand compute the average Intersection over Union (IoU) across the entire test\nset. We contribute to finding that BoS score has a strong, positive correlation\nwith detection accuracy measured by mean average precision (mAP) under various\ntest environments.

Thus, a promising zero-shot image classification strategy is\nselecting the most appropriate Pre-Trained VLM from the VLM Zoo, relying solely\non the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images.\nIn this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a\nVLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the \"Modality Gap\" -- the disparity in\nVLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable\nsubstitute for images; and the \"Capability Gap\" -- the discrepancy between the\nVLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct\nprediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general\nperformance.

However,\ntraditional VAC methods have overlooked the complexity of action repetitions,\nsuch as interruptions and the variability in cycle duration. Our research\naddresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called\nIrregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular\nrepetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:\nInter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle\nConsistency ensures homogeneity in the spatial-temporal representations of\ncycle segments, signifying action uniformity within cycles. Cycle-interval\ninconsistency highlights the importance of distinguishing between cycle\nsegments and intervals based on their inherent content differences. To\nencapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes\nconsistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss\n(P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence\namong cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of\ncycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the\nRepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in\nVAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional\nadaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming\nexisting models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the\nneed for dataset-specific optimization.

Our framework is currently evaluated on simple formation\ntargets, limited to contour shapes. A formation is visually represented through\nalpha-shape contours and the most representative color is automatically found\nfor the input word. To measure the similarity between the description and the\nvisual representation of the formation, we use CLIP [1], encoding text and\nimages into vectors and assessing their similarity. Subsequently, the algorithm\nrearranges the formation to visually represent the word more effectively,\nwithin the given constraints of available drones. Control actions are then\nassigned to the drones, ensuring robotic behavior and collision-free movement.\nExperimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy in accurately modeling\nrobot formations from natural language descriptions. The algorithm's\nversatility is showcased through the execution of drone shows in photorealistic\nsimulation with varying shapes.

Previous works adopt the conventional\nclassification architecture, which consists of a feature extractor and a\nclassifier. The feature extractor is shared across sequentially arrived tasks\nor classes, but one specific group of weights of the classifier corresponding\nto one new class should be incrementally expanded. Consequently, the parameters\nof a continual learner gradually increase. Moreover, as the classifier contains\nall historical arrived classes, a certain size of the memory is usually\nrequired to store rehearsal data to mitigate classifier bias and catastrophic\nforgetting. In this paper, we propose a non-incremental learner, named\nAttriCLIP, to incrementally extract knowledge of new classes or tasks.\nSpecifically, AttriCLIP is built upon the pre-trained visual-language model\nCLIP. Its image encoder and text encoder are fixed to extract features from\nboth images and text.

The attribute prompts,\nwhich encode the common knowledge useful for classification, can effectively\nmitigate the catastrophic forgetting and avoid constructing a replay memory. We\nevaluate our AttriCLIP and compare it with CLIP-based and previous\nstate-of-the-art continual learning methods in realistic settings with\ndomain-shift and long-sequence learning.

Given one modality-missing scenario, we propose to\nutilize the available modality to generate the prompt of the missing modality\nto adapt to RGBT tracking model. However, the cross-modality gap between\navailable and missing modalities usually causes semantic distortion and\ninformation loss in prompt generation. To handle this issue, we design the\ninvertible prompter by incorporating the full reconstruction of the input\navailable modality from the generated prompt. To provide a comprehensive\nevaluation platform, we construct several high-quality benchmark datasets, in\nwhich various modality-missing scenarios are considered to simulate real-world\nchallenges.

Traditional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging\n(T1-MRI) research focus on identifying brain atrophy regions but often fails to\naddress the intricate connectivity between them. This limitation underscores\nthe necessity of focuing on inter-regional connectivity for a comprehensive\nunderstand of the brain's complex network.

These\nare essential for developing high-quality feature representations that reveal\ncritical spatial impacts of structural brain changes and its topology. In this\npaper, we propose Brain-SubGNN, a novel graph representation network to mine\nand enhance critical subgraphs based on T1-MRI. This network provides a\nsubgraph-level interpretation, enhancing interpretability and insights for\ngraph analysis.

The condition is pretty common in the real world. It\ncauses low-contrast images where details are concealed in the darkness and\ncamera sensor noise significantly degrades the image quality. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose to learn to decompose illumination, reflectance, and noise\nfrom input views according to that reflectance remains invariant across\nheterogeneous views. To cope with heterogeneous brightness and noise levels\nacross multi-views, we learn an illumination embedding and optimize a noise map\nindividually for each view.

We point out that MiO\nIR faces two pivotal challenges: the optimization of diverse objectives and the\nadaptation to multiple tasks. To tackle these challenges, we present two simple\nyet effective strategies. The first strategy, referred to as sequential\nlearning, attempts to address how to optimize the diverse objectives, which\nguides the network to incrementally learn individual IR tasks in a sequential\nmanner rather than mixing them together. The second strategy, i.e., prompt\nlearning, attempts to address how to adapt to the different IR tasks, which\nassists the network to understand the specific task and improves the\ngeneralization ability. By evaluating on 19 test sets, we demonstrate that the\nsequential and prompt learning strategies can significantly enhance the MiO\nperformance of commonly used CNN and Transformer backbones.

Pioneering\nworks like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition.\nHowever, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps\nare independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single\nlinear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously.

In this way, the input and output could be represented in a\nunified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible.\nHowever, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units\n-words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal\nand semantic relations.

This paper highlights the limitations in\nstate-of-the-art continuous learning systems: (1) they focus on computations\nfor retraining, while overlooking the compute needs for inference and labeling,\n(2) they rely on power-hungry GPUs, unsuitable for battery-operated autonomous\nsystems, and (3) they are located on a remote centralized server, intended for\nmulti-tenant scenarios, again unsuitable for autonomous systems due to privacy,\nnetwork availability, and latency concerns. We propose a hardware-algorithm\nco-designed solution for continuous learning, DaCapo, that enables autonomous\nsystems to perform concurrent executions of inference, labeling, and training\nin a performant and energy-efficient manner. DaCapo comprises (1) a\nspatially-partitionable and precision-flexible accelerator enabling parallel\nexecution of kernels on sub-accelerators at their respective precisions, and\n(2) a spatiotemporal resource allocation algorithm that strategically navigates\nthe resource-accuracy tradeoff space, facilitating optimal decisions for\nresource allocation to achieve maximal accuracy. Our evaluation shows that\nDaCapo achieves 6.5% and 5.5% higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art GPU-based\ncontinuous learning systems, Ekya and EOMU, respectively, while consuming 254x\nless power.\n","authors":["Yoonsung Kim","Changhun Oh","Jinwoo Hwang","Wonung Kim","Seongryong Oh","Yubin Lee","Hardik Sharma","Amir Yazdanbakhsh","Jongse Park"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14353v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14347v1","updated":"2024-03-21T12:24:01Z","published":"2024-03-21T12:24:01Z","title":"A Comparative Study of Real-Time Implementable Cooperative Aerial\n  Manipulation Systems","summary":"  This survey paper focuses on quadrotor- and multirotor- based cooperative\naerial manipulation.

However, vibrations in human\nmotion and the uneven distribution of point cloud features in complex\nenvironments often lead to rapid drift, which is a prevalent issue when\napplying existing LiDAR Inertial Odometry (LIO) methods on low-cost WMS. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel LIO for WMSs based on Hybrid\nContinuous Time Optimization (HCTO) considering the optimality of Lidar\ncorrespondences. First, HCTO recognizes patterns in human motion\n(high-frequency part, low-frequency part, and constant velocity part) by\nanalyzing raw IMU measurements. Second, HCTO constructs hybrid IMU factors\naccording to different motion states, which enables robust and accurate\nestimation against vibration-induced noise in the IMU measurements. Third, the\nbest point correspondences are selected using optimal design to achieve\nreal-time performance and better odometry accuracy. We conduct experiments on\nhead-mounted WMS datasets to evaluate the performance of our system,\ndemonstrating significant advantages over state-of-the-art methods.

Human corrective feedback is a\ncrucial form of guidance to enable such generalization. However, adapting to\nand learning from online human corrections is a non-trivial endeavor: not only\ndo robots need to remember human feedback over time to retrieve the right\ninformation in new settings and reduce the intervention rate, but also they\nwould need to be able to respond to feedback that can be arbitrary corrections\nabout high-level human preferences to low-level adjustments to skill\nparameters.

One natural\nsolution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner\nwhere each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and\npreviously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering\nworks like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition.\nHowever, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps\nare independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single\nlinear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They\ndominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training\nMLPs compared to autoregressive networks.\n  In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion\nforecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a\nunified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible.\nHowever, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units\n-words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal\nand semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized\nattention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and\ndifferent position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding\nthe transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while\nadopting RoPE for temporal relativity. Empirically, by equipping with the\naforementioned tailored designs, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in the Waymo Open Motion and Waymo Interaction datasets.

The redundant DOF offers greater\nmanipulability of the arm configuration to avoid obstacles and singularities,\nbut it must be parameterized to fully specify the joint angles for a given end\neffector pose. For 7-DOF revolute (7R) manipulators, we introduce a new concept\nof generalized shoulder-elbow-wrist (SEW) angle, a generalization of the\nconventional SEW angle but with an arbitrary choice of the reference direction\nfunction. The SEW angle is widely used and easy for human operators to\nvisualize as a rotation of the elbow about the shoulder-wrist line. Since other\nredundancy parameterizations including the conventional SEW angle encounter an\nalgorithmic singularity along a line in the workspace, we introduce a special\nchoice of the reference direction function called the stereographic SEW angle\nwhich has a singularity only along a half-line, which can be placed out of\nreach.

As such, we present\nGelLink, a compact, underactuated, linkage-driven robotic finger with low-cost,\nhigh-resolution vision-based tactile sensing and proprioceptive sensing\ncapabilities. In order to reduce the amount of embedded hardware, i.e. the\ncameras and motors, we optimize the linkage transmission with a planar linkage\nmechanism simulator and develop a planar reflection simulator to simplify the\ntactile sensing hardware. As a result, GelLink only requires one motor to\nactuate the three phalanges, and one camera to capture tactile signals along\nthe entire finger.

Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input\nfor a progressively guided restoration. With this approach, the model achieves\nadaptive reconstruction by accentuating the informative frequency subbands\naccording to different input degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different\nimage restoration tasks, including denoising, dehazing, deraining, motion\ndeblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

In this setting,\ncross-task distillation can be used, enabling the use of any teacher model\ntrained on a different task. However, many KD methods prove ineffective when\napplied to this cross-task setting. To address this limitation, we propose a\nsimple modification: the use of an inverted projection. We show that this\ndrop-in replacement for a standard projector is effective by learning to\ndisregard any task-specific features which might degrade the student's\nperformance. We find that this simple modification is sufficient for extending\nmany KD methods to the cross-task setting, where the teacher and student tasks\ncan be very different. In doing so, we obtain up to a 1.9% improvement in the\ncross-task setting compared to the traditional projection, at no additional\ncost. Our method can obtain significant performance improvements (up to 7%)\nwhen using even a randomly-initialised teacher on various tasks such as depth\nestimation, image translation, and semantic segmentation, despite the lack of\nany learned knowledge to transfer. To provide conceptual and analytical\ninsights into this result, we show that using an inverted projection allows the\ndistillation loss to be decomposed into a knowledge transfer and a spectral\nregularisation component.

Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy,\ntheir size can be effectively reduced by \"tensorization\" while maintaining\naccuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with\ncompact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or\nquantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly\ntraining the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards\nlow-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the\naccuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution\nkernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we\ntruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50\npre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We\nfound that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be\ntruncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but\nnot in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation\ncompression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how\ninformation is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated\nmodels could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs\nof re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of\nconvolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum.

To accomplish this task, we employ ReSkin,\nan inexpensive and replaceable magnetic-based tactile sensor. Using ReSkin, we\ncollect and train PseudoTouch on a dataset comprising aligned tactile and\nvisual data pairs obtained through random touching of eight basic geometric\nshapes. We demonstrate the efficacy of PseudoTouch through its application to\ntwo downstream tasks: object recognition and grasp stability prediction. In the\nobject recognition task, we evaluate the learned embedding's performance on a\nset of five basic geometric shapes and five household objects. Using\nPseudoTouch, we achieve an object recognition accuracy 84% after just ten\ntouches, surpassing a proprioception baseline. For the grasp stability task, we\nuse ACRONYM labels to train and evaluate a grasp success predictor using\nPseudoTouch's predictions derived from virtual depth information. Our approach\nyields an impressive 32% absolute improvement in accuracy compared to the\nbaseline relying on partial point cloud data.

The marked numbers ground image\nlocations in the real-world, direct the VLM's attention solely to navigable\nlocations, and elucidate the spatial relationships between them and terrains\ndepicted in the image to the VLM. Next, we query the VLM to select numbers on\nthe marked image that satisfy the context-based behavior text prompt, and\nconstruct a reference path using the selected numbers. Finally, we propose a\nmethod to extrapolate the reference trajectory when the robot's environmental\ncontext has not changed to prevent unnecessary VLM queries.

While arthroplasty has known several technical\nimprovements, a significant share of patients are still unsatisfied with their\nsurgery. Personalised arthroplasty improves surgical outcomes however current\nsolutions require delays, making it difficult to integrate in clinical routine.\nWe propose a fully automated workflow to design patient-specific implants,\npresented for total knee arthroplasty, the most widely performed arthroplasty\nin the world nowadays.\n  The proposed pipeline first uses artificial neural networks to segment the\nproximal and distal extremities of the femur and tibia. Then the full bones are\nreconstructed using augmented statistical shape models, combining shape and\nlandmarks information. Finally, 77 morphological parameters are computed to\ndesign patient-specific implants. The developed workflow has been trained using\n91 CT scans of lower limb and evaluated on 41 CT scans manually segmented, in\nterms of accuracy and execution time.\n  The workflow accuracy was $0.4\\pm0.2mm$ for the segmentation, $1.2\\pm0.4mm$\nfor the full bones reconstruction, and $2.8\\pm2.2mm$ for the anatomical\nlandmarks determination. The custom implants fitted the patients' anatomy with\n$0.6\\pm0.2mm$ accuracy. The whole process from segmentation to implants' design\nlasted about 5 minutes.\n  The proposed workflow allows for a fast and reliable personalisation of knee\nimplants, directly from the patient CT image without requiring any manual\nintervention. It establishes a patient-specific pre-operative planning for TKA\nin a very short time making it easily available for all patients. Combined with\nefficient implant manufacturing techniques, this solution could help answer the\ngrowing number of arthroplasties while reducing complications and improving the\npatients' satisfaction.\n","authors":["Aziliz Guezou-Philippe","Arnaud Clav√©","Ehouarn Maguet","Ludivine Maintier","Charles Garraud","Jean-Rassaire Fouefack","Val√©rie Burdin","Eric Stindel","Guillaume Dardenne"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15353v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14125v3","updated":"2024-03-22T17:06:53Z","published":"2023-12-21T18:46:41Z","title":"VideoPoet: A Large Language Model for Zero-Shot Video Generation","summary":"  We present VideoPoet, a language model capable of synthesizing high-quality\nvideo, with matching audio, from a large variety of conditioning signals.\nVideoPoet employs a decoder-only transformer architecture that processes\nmultimodal inputs -- including images, videos, text, and audio.

However, training vision transformers for high-resolution\npixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to\nhierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on\nlow-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural\nchoices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions\nsignificantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and\nslow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for\nefficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The\nkey principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during\ntraining, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local\ninteractions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between\ntokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the\nhigh-resolution input at test time without any special trick.

First, a loss is proposed to delay the occurrence of\nend-of-sequence (EOS) token, where EOS token is a signal for VLMs to stop\ngenerating further tokens. Moreover, an uncertainty loss and a token diversity\nloss are proposed to increase the uncertainty over each generated token and the\ndiversity among all tokens of the whole generated sequence, respectively, which\ncan break output dependency at token-level and sequence-level. Furthermore, a\ntemporal weight adjustment algorithm is proposed, which can effectively balance\nthese losses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our verbose images can\nincrease the length of generated sequences by 7.87 times and 8.56 times\ncompared to original images on MS-COCO and ImageNet datasets, which presents\npotential challenges for various applications.

However, its direct adaption in medical image\nsegmentation tasks shows significant performance drops with inferior accuracy\nand unstable results. It may also requires an excessive number of prompt points\nto obtain a reasonable accuracy. For segmenting 3D radiological CT or MRI\nscans, a 2D SAM model has to separately handle hundreds of 2D slices. Although\nquite a few studies explore adapting SAM into medical image volumes, the\nefficiency of 2D adaption methods is unsatisfactory and 3D adaptation methods\nonly capable of segmenting specific organs/tumors. In this work, we propose a\ncomprehensive and scalable 3D SAM model for whole-body CT segmentation, named\nCT-SAM3D. Instead of adapting SAM, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation\nmodel using a (nearly) fully labeled CT dataset. To train CT-SAM3D effectively,\nensuring the model's accurate responses to higher-dimensional spatial prompts\nis crucial, and 3D patch-wise training is required due to GPU memory\nconstraints. For this purpose, we propose two key technical developments: 1) a\nprogressively and spatially aligned prompt encoding method to effectively\nencode click prompts in local 3D space; and 2) a cross-patch prompt learning\nscheme to capture more 3D spatial context, which is beneficial for reducing the\nediting workloads when interactively prompting on large organs.

With the rapid deployment of deep neural networks\nfor SOD tasks, the demand for high-quality training samples soars. The\ntraditional, also reliable, way is manual labeling over the dense LiDAR point\nclouds and reference images. Though most public driving datasets adopt this\nstrategy to provide SOD ground truth (GT), it is still expensive (requires\nLiDAR scanners) and low-efficient (time-consuming and unscalable) in practice.\nThis paper introduces VRSO, a visual-centric approach for static object\nannotation. VRSO is distinguished in low cost, high efficiency, and high\nquality: (1) It recovers static objects in 3D space with only camera images as\ninput, and (2) manual labeling is barely involved since GT for SOD tasks is\ngenerated based on an automatic reconstruction and annotation pipeline.

When it contains only specific types of images, the classifier begins\nto rely on shortcuts - simplistic and erroneous rules for decision-making. This\nleads to high performance on the training dataset but inferior results on new,\nvaried images, as the classifier's generalization capability is reduced. For\nexample, if the images labeled as mustache consist solely of male figures, the\nmodel may inadvertently learn to classify images by gender rather than the\npresence of a mustache. One approach to mitigate such biases is to direct the\nmodel's attention toward the target object's location, usually marked using\nbounding boxes or polygons for annotation. However, collecting such annotations\nrequires substantial time and human effort. Therefore, we propose a novel\npatch-labeling method that integrates AI assistance with crowdsourcing to\ncapture human attention from images, which can be a viable solution for\nmitigating bias. Our method consists of two steps. First, we extract the\napproximate location of a target using a pre-trained saliency detection model\nsupplemented by human verification for accuracy. Then, we determine the\nhuman-attentive area in the image by iteratively dividing the image into\nsmaller patches and employing crowdsourcing to ascertain whether each patch can\nbe classified as the target object. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our\nmethod in mitigating bias through improved classification accuracy and the\nrefined focus of the model. Also, crowdsourced experiments validate that our\nmethod collects human annotation up to 3.4 times faster than annotating object\nlocations with polygons, significantly reducing the need for human resources.\nWe conclude the paper by discussing the advantages of our method in a\ncrowdsourcing context, mainly focusing on aspects of human errors and\naccessibility.\n","authors":["Minsuk Chang","Seokhyeon Park","Hyeon Jeon","Aeri Cho","Soohyun Lee","Jinwook Seo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15013v1.pdf","comment":"21 pages, 11 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00029v3","updated":"2024-03-22T07:52:28Z","published":"2023-12-29T05:28:35Z","title":"6D-Diff: A Keypoint Diffusion Framework for 6D Object Pose Estimation","summary":"  Estimating the 6D object pose from a single RGB image often involves noise\nand indeterminacy due to challenges such as occlusions and cluttered\nbackgrounds.

This practice is widely\nregarded as secure, even in cases where some annotated errors occur, as the\nimpact of these minor inaccuracies on the final performance of the models is\nnegligible and existing backdoor attacks require attacker's ability to poison\nthe training images. Nevertheless, in this paper, we propose clean-image\nbackdoor attacks which uncover that backdoors can still be injected via a\nfraction of incorrect labels without modifying the training images.\nSpecifically, in our attacks, the attacker first seeks a trigger feature to\ndivide the training images into two parts: those with the feature and those\nwithout it. Subsequently, the attacker falsifies the labels of the former part\nto a backdoor class. The backdoor will be finally implanted into the target\nmodel after it is trained on the poisoned data. During the inference phase, the\nattacker can activate the backdoor in two ways: slightly modifying the input\nimage to obtain the trigger feature, or taking an image that naturally has the\ntrigger feature as input. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness and practicality of our attacks.

Specifically, the Gait\nRepresentation Extractor (GRE) within BigGait draws upon design principles from\nestablished gait representations, effectively transforming all-purpose\nknowledge into implicit gait representations without requiring third-party\nsupervision signals. Experiments on CCPG, CAISA-B* and SUSTech1K indicate that\nBigGait significantly outperforms the previous methods in both within-domain\nand cross-domain tasks in most cases, and provides a more practical paradigm\nfor learning the next-generation gait representation. Finally, we delve into\nprospective challenges and promising directions in LVMs-based gait recognition,\naiming to inspire future work in this emerging topic.

While a considerable amount of research has been\ndedicated to remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic\nsegmentation, most of these studies have overlooked the valuable prior\nknowledge embedded within remote sensing scenarios.

This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large\nSelective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone.

Despite its superiority in VSR accuracy, the heavy computational burden\nas well as the large memory footprint hinder the deployment of\nTransformer-based VSR models on constrained devices. In this paper, we address\nthe above issue by proposing a novel feature-level masked processing framework:\nVSR with Masked Intra and inter frame Attention (MIA-VSR). The core of MIA-VSR\nis leveraging feature-level temporal continuity between adjacent frames to\nreduce redundant computations and make more rational use of previously enhanced\nSR features. Concretely, we propose an intra-frame and inter-frame attention\nblock which takes the respective roles of past features and input features into\nconsideration and only exploits previously enhanced features to provide\nsupplementary information. In addition, an adaptive block-wise mask prediction\nmodule is developed to skip unimportant computations according to feature\nsimilarity between adjacent frames.

However, curbs are difficult to\ndetect due to the complex road environment. This paper introduces CurbNet, a\nnovel framework for curb detection, leveraging point cloud segmentation.\nAddressing the dearth of comprehensive curb datasets and the absence of 3D\nannotations, we have developed the 3D-Curb dataset, encompassing 7,100 frames,\nwhich represents the largest and most categorically diverse collection of curb\npoint clouds currently available. Recognizing that curbs are primarily\ncharacterized by height variations, our approach harnesses spatially-rich 3D\npoint clouds for training. To tackle the challenges presented by the uneven\ndistribution of curb features on the xy-plane and their reliance on z-axis\nhigh-frequency features, we introduce the multi-scale and channel attention\n(MSCA) module, a bespoke solution designed to optimize detection performance.\nMoreover, we propose an adaptive weighted loss function group, specifically\nformulated to counteract the imbalance in the distribution of curb point clouds\nrelative to other categories. Our extensive experimentation on 2 major datasets\nhas yielded results that surpass existing benchmarks set by leading curb\ndetection and point cloud segmentation models.

The rise of foundation models trained on\nmultiple tasks with impressively large datasets from a variety of fields has\nled researchers to believe that these models may provide common sense reasoning\nthat existing planners are missing. Researchers posit that this common sense\nreasoning will bridge the gap between algorithm development and deployment to\nout-of-distribution tasks, like how humans adapt to unexpected scenarios.

Classically, we treat such a learning problem and the\ndownstream decision-making problem as two decoupled problems, i.e., we first\nlearn to predict the cost function without considering the downstream\ndecision-making problem, and then use the learned function for predicting the\ncost and using it in the decision-making problem. However, the loss function\nused in learning a prediction function may not be aligned with the downstream\ndecision-making. We propose a decision-oriented learning framework that\nincorporates the downstream task performance in the prediction phase via a\ndifferentiable optimization layer. The main computational challenge in such a\nframework is to make the combinatorial optimization, i.e., non-monotone\nsubmodular maximization, differentiable. This function is not naturally\ndifferentiable. We propose the Differentiable Cost Scaled Greedy algorithm\n(D-CSG), which is a continuous and differentiable relaxation of CSG. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework through numerical\nsimulations. The results show that the proposed framework can result in better\nperformance than the traditional two-stage approach.\n","authors":["Guangyao Shi","Chak Lam Shek","Nare Karapetyan","Pratap Tokekar"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01519v2.pdf","comment":"arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.01543"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17147v1","updated":"2024-03-25T19:50:07Z","published":"2024-03-25T19:50:07Z","title":"Hearing the shape of an arena with spectral swarm robotics","summary":"  Swarm robotics promises adaptability to unknown situations and robustness\nagainst failures. However, it still struggles with global tasks that require\nunderstanding the broader context in which the robots operate, such as\nidentifying the shape of the arena in which the robots are embedded. Biological\nswarms, such as shoals of fish, flocks of birds, and colonies of insects,\nroutinely solve global geometrical problems through the diffusion of local\ncues. This paradigm can be explicitly described by mathematical models that\ncould be directly computed and exploited by a robotic swarm. Diffusion over a\ndomain is mathematically encapsulated by the Laplacian, a linear operator that\nmeasures the local curvature of a function. Crucially the geometry of a domain\ncan generally be reconstructed from the eigenspectrum of its Laplacian. Here we\nintroduce spectral swarm robotics where robots diffuse information to their\nneighbors to emulate the Laplacian operator - enabling them to \"hear\" the\nspectrum of their arena.

Though\nvarious methods have been proposed to boost transferability, the performance\nstill falls short compared with white-box attacks. In this work, we observe\nthat existing input transformation based attacks, one of the mainstream\ntransfer-based attacks, result in different attention heatmaps on various\nmodels, which might limit the transferability. We also find that breaking the\nintrinsic relation of the image can disrupt the attention heatmap of the\noriginal image. Based on this finding, we propose a novel input transformation\nbased attack called block shuffle and rotation (BSR).

This hybrid\napproach leverages the robust capabilities of large models to effectively\nutilise large unlabelled data whilst subsequently providing the small student\nmodel with rich and informative features for enhancement. The proposed\nsemi-supervised learning-based knowledge distillation (SSLKD) approach\ndemonstrates a notable improvement in the performance of the student model, in\nthe application of road segmentation, surpassing the effectiveness of\ntraditional semi-supervised learning methods.\n","authors":["Wanli Ma","Oktay Karakus","Paul L.

Finally, 77 morphological parameters are computed to\ndesign patient-specific implants.

The custom implants fitted the patients' anatomy with\n$0.6\\pm0.2mm$ accuracy.

In this paper, we employ natural traces shared only by\nreal images as an additional predictive target in the detector. Specifically,\nthe natural traces are learned from the wild real images and we introduce\nextended supervised contrastive learning to bring them closer to real images\nand further away from fake ones. This motivates the detector to make decisions\nbased on the proximity of images to the natural traces.

The relevance between the pretraining pretext and target\ntasks is crucial to the success of transfer learning. Various pretext tasks\nhave been proposed to utilize properties of medical image data (e.g., three\ndimensionality), which are more relevant to medical image analysis than generic\nones for natural images. However, previous work rarely paid attention to data\nwith anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance\nimaging views. As these imaging planes are defined according to the anatomy of\nthe imaged organ, pretext tasks effectively exploiting this information can\npretrain the networks to gain knowledge on the organ of interest. In this work,\nwe propose two complementary pretext tasks for this group of medical image data\nbased on the spatial relationship of the imaging planes. The first is to learn\nthe relative orientation between the imaging planes and implemented as\nregressing their intersecting lines. The second exploits parallel imaging\nplanes to regress their relative slice locations within a stack.

Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors,\nwe present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework,\nHalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to\nidentify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically.\nInterestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising\nfrom long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on\nthat, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data\ndistribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations.\nComprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our\nmethod successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains\ncompetitive performance compared to LLaVA.

Errors in assembly can lead to\nsignificant consequences such as extended surgery times, and prolonged\nmanufacturing or maintenance times in industry. Assembly scenarios can benefit\nfrom in-situ AR visualization to provide guidance, reduce assembly times and\nminimize errors. To enable in-situ visualization 6D pose estimation can be\nleveraged. Existing 6D pose estimation techniques primarily focus on individual\nobjects and static captures. However, assembly scenarios have various dynamics\nincluding occlusion during assembly and dynamics in the assembly objects\nappearance. Existing work, combining object detection/6D pose estimation and\nassembly state detection focuses either on pure deep learning-based approaches,\nor limit the assembly state detection to building blocks. To address the\nchallenges of 6D pose estimation in combination with assembly state detection,\nour approach ASDF builds upon the strengths of YOLOv8, a real-time capable\nobject detection framework.

Consequently, the 4D CBCT images are covered by severe streak\nartifacts. Although several deep learning-based methods have been proposed to\naddress this issue, most algorithms employ ordinary network models, neglecting\nthe intrinsic structural prior within 4D CBCT images. In this paper, we first\nexplore the origin and appearance of streak artifacts in 4D CBCT\nimages.Specifically, we find that streak artifacts exhibit a periodic\nrotational motion along with the patient's respiration. This unique motion\npattern inspires us to distinguish the artifacts from the desired anatomical\nstructures in the spatiotemporal domain.

Furthermore, we find that simply\nchanging the adversarial training examples in pre-processing methods does not\ncompletely alleviate the robustness degradation effect.

Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various\nscenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when\ndealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different\ndevices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion\n(SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new\ninformative labeled samples.

First, when a task plan is found to\nbe unfeasible due to the geometric constraints, the combinatorial search\nresumes in a specific sub-problem. Second, the sampling of object\nconfigurations is not done once, globally, at the start of the search, but\nlocally, at the start of each subproblem. Optimizations of this basic setting\nare also considered and experimental results over existing and new\npick-and-place benchmarks are reported.\n","authors":["Mag√≠ Dalmau-Moreno","N√©stor Garc√≠a","Vicen√ß G√≥mez","H√©ctor Geffner"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16277v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16275v1","updated":"2024-03-24T19:47:37Z","published":"2024-03-24T19:47:37Z","title":"M^3RS: Multi-robot, Multi-objective, and Multi-mode Routing and\n  Scheduling","summary":"  In this paper, we present a novel problem coined multi-robot,\nmulti-objective, and multi-mode routing and scheduling (M^3RS).

To address\nthese issues, we design an analytical robustness metric for bipedal locomotion\nand quantify this metric using STL specifications, which guide the generation\nof recovery trajectories to achieve maximum locomotion robustness. To enable\nsafe and computational-efficient crossed-leg maneuver, we design data-driven\nself-leg-collision constraints that are $1000$ times faster than the\ntraditional inverse-kinematics-based approach. Our framework outperforms a\nstate-of-the-art locomotion controller, a standard MPC without STL, and a\nlinear-temporal-logic-based planner in a high-fidelity dynamic simulation,\nespecially in scenarios involving crossed-leg maneuvers. Additionally, the\nCassie bipedal robot achieves robust performance under horizontal and\norientational perturbations such as those observed in ship motions. These\nenvironments are validated in simulations and deployed on hardware.\nFurthermore, our proposed method demonstrates versatility on stepping stones\nand terrain-agnostic features on inclined terrains.\n","authors":["Zhaoyuan Gu","Yuntian Zhao","Yipu Chen","Rongming Guo","Jennifer K.

We explore this question through a\nmodel, assuming that the learner is able to pick up and place small objects\nfrom, and to, locations of its choosing, and will spontaneously engage in such\nundirected manipulation. We further assume that the learner's visual system\nwill monitor the changing arrangements of objects in the scene and will learn\nto predict the effects of each action by comparing perception with a\nsupervisory signal from the motor system. We model perception using standard\ndeep networks for feature extraction and classification, and gradient descent\nlearning. Our main finding is that, from learning the task of action\nprediction, an unexpected image representation emerges exhibiting regularities\nthat foreshadow the perception and representation of numbers and quantity.\nThese include distinct categories for zero and the first few natural numbers, a\nstrict ordering of the numbers, and a one-dimensional signal that correlates\nwith numerical quantity. As a result, our model acquires the ability to\nestimate numerosity, i.e. the number of objects in the scene, as well as\nsubitization, i.e. the ability to recognize at a glance the exact number of\nobjects in small scenes. Remarkably, subitization and numerosity estimation\nextrapolate to scenes containing many objects, far beyond the three objects\nused during training.

The vast majority of modern MAPF solvers\nfocus on improving CBS by reducing the size of this tree through various\nstrategies with few methods modifying the low level planner. Typically low\nlevel planners in existing CBS methods use an unweighted cost-to-go heuristic,\nwith suboptimal CBS methods also using a conflict heuristic to help the high\nlevel search. In this paper, we show that, contrary to prevailing CBS beliefs,\na weighted cost-to-go heuristic can be used effectively alongside the conflict\nheuristic in two possible variants. In particular, one of these variants can\nobtain large speedups, 2-100x, across several scenarios and suboptimal CBS\nmethods.

To address this\nissue, in this work we propose to predict instance segmentations for 3D scenes\nin an unsupervised way, without relying on ground-truth annotations. To this\nend, we construct a learning framework consisting of two components: (1) a\npseudo-annotation scheme for generating initial unsupervised pseudo-labels; and\n(2) a self-training algorithm for instance segmentation to fit robust, accurate\ninstances from initial noisy proposals.

In response to\nthese limitations, the concept of distilling the information on a dataset into\na condensed set of (synthetic) samples, namely a distilled dataset, emerged.\nOne crucial aspect is the selected architecture (usually ConvNet) for linking\nthe original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if\nthe employed model architecture differs from the model used during\ndistillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images,\ne.g., 128x128 and higher.

We desire the trained policy to ensure that the agent satisfies\nspecific task objectives, expressed in discrete-time Signal Temporal Logic\n(DT-STL). One advantage for reformulation of a task via formal frameworks, like\nDT-STL, is that it permits quantitative satisfaction semantics. In other words,\ngiven a trajectory and a DT-STL formula, we can compute the robustness, which\ncan be interpreted as an approximate signed distance between the trajectory and\nthe set of trajectories satisfying the formula. We utilize feedback\ncontrollers, and we assume a feed forward neural network for learning these\nfeedback controllers. We show how this learning problem is similar to training\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the number of recurrent units is\nproportional to the temporal horizon of the agent's task objectives. This poses\na challenge: RNNs are susceptible to vanishing and exploding gradients, and\nna\\\"{i}ve gradient descent-based strategies to solve long-horizon task\nobjectives thus suffer from the same problems. To tackle this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel gradient approximation algorithm based on the idea of dropout\nor gradient sampling. We show that, the existing smooth semantics for\nrobustness are inefficient regarding gradient computation when the\nspecification becomes complex. To address this challenge, we propose a new\nsmooth semantics for DT-STL that under-approximates the robustness value and\nscales well for backpropagation over a complex specification. We show that our\ncontrol synthesis methodology, can be quite helpful for stochastic gradient\ndescent to converge with less numerical issues, enabling scalable\nbackpropagation over long time horizons and trajectories over high dimensional\nstate spaces.\n","authors":["Navid Hashemi","Bardh Hoxha","Danil Prokhorov","Georgios Fainekos","Jyotirmoy Deshmukh"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15826v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14945v2","updated":"2024-03-23T12:39:14Z","published":"2023-09-26T14:00:25Z","title":"Integration of Large Language Models within Cognitive Architectures for\n  Autonomous Robots","summary":"  Symbolic reasoning systems have been used in cognitive architectures to\nprovide inference and planning capabilities.

Our framework, comprising interactive exploration, feature\nextraction, and classification stages, prioritizes simplicity and transparency\nfor seamless integration into various manipulation pipelines. We evaluate the\nproposed approach through extensive experiments with a real-world dataset\ncomprising 11 granular materials, which we also make publicly available.\nAdditionally, we conducted a comprehensive qualitative analysis of the dataset\nto offer deeper insights into its nature, aiding future development. Our\nresults show that the proposed method is capable of accurately identifying a\nwide range of granular materials solely relying on force measurements obtained\nfrom direct interaction with the materials.

This paper introduces three key components that enhance the MPCC\napproach for drone racing. First and foremost, we provide safety guarantees in\nthe form of a constraint and terminal set. The safety set is designed as a\nspatial constraint which prevents gate collisions while allowing for\ntime-optimization only in the cost function.

Furthermore, generalization to unseen objects is\nhindered by the limited scale of available hand-object interaction datasets. We\npropose DiffH2O, a novel method to synthesize realistic, one or two-handed\nobject interactions from provided text prompts and geometry of the object. The\nmethod introduces three techniques that enable effective learning from limited\ndata. First, we decompose the task into a grasping stage and a text-based\ninteraction stage and use separate diffusion models for each. In the grasping\nstage, the model only generates hand motions, whereas in the interaction phase\nboth hand and object poses are synthesized. Second, we propose a compact\nrepresentation that tightly couples hand and object poses. Third, we propose\ntwo different guidance schemes to allow more control of the generated motions:\ngrasp guidance and detailed textual guidance. Grasp guidance takes a single\ntarget grasping pose and guides the diffusion model to reach this grasp at the\nend of the grasping stage, which provides control over the grasping pose. Given\na grasping motion from this stage, multiple different actions can be prompted\nin the interaction phase.

Current efforts attempt to learn object-centric representations from\nmotion in videos. In particular, SiamMAE recently introduced a Siamese network,\ntraining a shared-weight encoder from two frames of a video with a high\nasymmetric masking ratio (95%). In this work, we propose CropMAE, an\nalternative approach to the Siamese pre-training introduced by SiamMAE. Our\nmethod specifically differs by exclusively considering pairs of cropped images\nsourced from the same image but cropped differently, deviating from the\nconventional pairs of frames extracted from a video. CropMAE therefore\nalleviates the need for video datasets, while maintaining competitive\nperformances and drastically reducing pre-training time. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that CropMAE learns similar object-centric representations without\nexplicit motion, showing that current self-supervised learning methods do not\nlearn objects from motion, but rather thanks to the Siamese architecture.\nFinally, CropMAE achieves the highest masking ratio to date (98.5%), enabling\nthe reconstruction of images using only two visible patches.

Traditional\nmethods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution,\nimplying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the\ncopyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase. DataCook operates by\n\"cooking\" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models\nthat perform normally on this processed data. However, during the deployment\nphase, the original test data must be also \"cooked\" through DataCook to ensure\nnormal model performance. This process grants copyright holders control over\nauthorization during the deployment phase. The mechanism behind DataCook is by\ncrafting anti-adversarial examples (AntiAdv), which are designed to enhance\nmodel confidence, as opposed to standard adversarial examples (Adv) that aim to\nconfuse models. Similar to Adv, AntiAdv introduces imperceptible perturbations,\nensuring that the data processed by DataCook remains easily understandable. We\nconducted extensive experiments on MedMNIST datasets, encompassing both 2D/3D\ndata and the high-resolution variants. The outcomes indicate that DataCook\neffectively meets its objectives, preventing models trained on AntiAdv from\nanalyzing unauthorized data effectively, without compromising the validity and\naccuracy of the data in legitimate scenarios.

However, we identify two key\nlimitations in a conventional label assignment for training Transformer-based\nVRD models, which is a process of mapping a ground-truth (GT) to a prediction.\nUnder the conventional assignment, an unspecialized query is trained since a\nquery is expected to detect every relation, which makes it difficult for a\nquery to specialize in specific relations.

This practice is widely\nregarded as secure, even in cases where some annotated errors occur, as the\nimpact of these minor inaccuracies on the final performance of the models is\nnegligible and existing backdoor attacks require attacker's ability to poison\nthe training images. Nevertheless, in this paper, we propose clean-image\nbackdoor attacks which uncover that backdoors can still be injected via a\nfraction of incorrect labels without modifying the training images.\nSpecifically, in our attacks, the attacker first seeks a trigger feature to\ndivide the training images into two parts: those with the feature and those\nwithout it. Subsequently, the attacker falsifies the labels of the former part\nto a backdoor class. The backdoor will be finally implanted into the target\nmodel after it is trained on the poisoned data. During the inference phase, the\nattacker can activate the backdoor in two ways: slightly modifying the input\nimage to obtain the trigger feature, or taking an image that naturally has the\ntrigger feature as input.

The integration\nof gaze guidance with the dynamics of hand-object interactions boosts the\naccuracy of human motion prediction. However, the lack of datasets that capture\nthe intricate relationship and consistency among gaze, hand, and object\nmovements remains a substantial hurdle. In this paper, we introduce the first\nGaze-guided Hand-Object Interaction dataset, GazeHOI, and present a novel task\nfor synthesizing gaze-guided hand-object interactions. Our dataset, GazeHOI,\nfeatures simultaneous 3D modeling of gaze, hand, and object interactions,\ncomprising 479 sequences with an average duration of 19.1 seconds, 812\nsub-sequences, and 33 objects of various sizes. We propose a hierarchical\nframework centered on a gaze-guided hand-object interaction diffusion model,\nnamed GHO-Diffusion. In the pre-diffusion phase, we separate gaze conditions\ninto spatial-temporal features and goal pose conditions at different levels of\ninformation granularity. During the diffusion phase, two gaze-conditioned\ndiffusion models are stacked to simplify the complex synthesis of hand-object\nmotions. Here, the object motion diffusion model generates sequences of object\nmotions based on gaze conditions, while the hand motion diffusion model\nproduces hand motions based on the generated object motion. To improve\nfine-grained goal pose alignment, we introduce a Spherical Gaussian constraint\nto guide the denoising step. In the subsequent post-diffusion phase, we\noptimize the generated hand motions using contact consistency.

Existing motion\nmagnification often fails to improve legibility since the intricate motions\nstill retain complex characteristics even after being magnified, which may\ndistract us from analyzing them. In this work, we focus on improving legibility\nby proposing a new concept, axial motion magnification, which magnifies\ndecomposed motions along the user-specified direction.

The main\nchallenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the\nsetting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields,\nwhich have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and\ngeometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\\\"ively supervising\nthem on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view\ninputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and\nhigh-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or\neven a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance\nfield weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve\nas a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This\nprior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively\naddressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure\nof the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a\nprior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in\na pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes\nfeature learning more effective. Consequently, one can fine-tune our field\nparameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions\nas well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views.

To solve image\nrestoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by\nincorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling\nprocess of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a\nchallenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large\ncomputational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present\nadditional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the\nnumber of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling\nsteps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration\nsolver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the\ndata consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a\nreconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that\nenforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates\nversatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent\nspace.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler.

Most\nmethods maintain consistent predictions of the unlabeled images under\nvariations (e.g., adding noise/perturbations, or creating alternative versions)\nin the image and/or model level. In most image-level variation, medical images\noften have prior structure information, which has not been well explored. In\nthis paper, we propose novel dual structure-aware image filterings (DSAIF) as\nthe image-level variations for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.\nMotivated by connected filtering that simplifies image via filtering in\nstructure-aware tree-based image representation, we resort to the dual contrast\ninvariant Max-tree and Min-tree representation. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel connected filtering that removes topologically equivalent nodes (i.e.\nconnected components) having no siblings in the Max/Min-tree. This results in\ntwo filtered images preserving topologically critical structure.

Our empirical\nexperiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as LVLMs often provide\nconfident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent\nvisual input. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward\nvision information, we introduce two simple, training-free strategies.
